In production codes, use Scanner class.

StdIn
StdIn class provides static methods for reading only standard input.
Make sure you have StdIn.class in Java classpath.
"In" is object-orientated version that handles input from files, URLs and sockets.
Methods are blocking, i.e. will wait until there is standard input.

To print, use StdOut.println() from StdOut class.

Methods to read tokens and converting to primitive types and strings:
isEmpty()
readInt()
readDouble()
readString()
readShort()
readLong()
readFloat()
readByte()
readBoolean()

A token is a maximal sequence of non-whitespace characters.
isEmpty() returns true if no more tokens in input.
Each other method reads token and attempts to convert it into a value of the specified type. If successful, will return value. If not, throws InputMismatchException. Will skip whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). StdIn uses whitespace as delimiter.

Methods to read characters:
hasNextChar() //true if have more input, including whitespace.
readChar() //returns next character, including whitespace.

Methods to read lines:
hasNextLine() // true if have more input
readLine()

Methods to read sequence of values of same type:
readAllDoubles()
readAllInts()
readAllLongs()
readAllStrings()
readAllLines()
readAll()
